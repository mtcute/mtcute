    /**
     * A slot machine.
     *
     * {@link value} represents the result of the machine.
     * Value itself is an integer in range `[1, 64]`,
     * and is composed out of several parts.
     *
     * > **Note**: The following information is based on the TDesktop
     * > implementation. These are the relevant files:
     * >  - [`chat_helpers/stickers_dice_pack.cpp`](https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/blob/dev/Telegram/SourceFiles/chat_helpers/stickers_dice_pack.cpp)
     * >  - [`history/view/media/history_view_slot_machine.cpp`](https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/blob/dev/Telegram/SourceFiles/history/view/media/history_view_slot_machine.cpp)
     *
     * Unlike other animated dices, this does not have
     * all the possible combinations in the sticker set.
     * Instead, `value` is a specially encoded integer that contains
     * the information about the indexes.
     *
     * There are some base parts of the animations:
     *  - 0th sticker is the base background of the machine
     *  - 1st sticker is the background of the machine for the "winning" state (i.e. `777`)
     *  - 2nd sticker is the frame of the machine, including the handle
     *  - 8th sticker is the "idle" state for the left slot
     *  - 14th sticker is the "idle" state for the middle slot
     *  - 20th sticker is the "idle" state for the right slot
     *
     * The machine result is encoded as 3 concatenated two-bit integers,
     * and the resulting integer is incremented by one.
     *
     * So, to decode the value to its parts, you can use this code:
     * ```typescript
     * const computePartValue = (val: number, idx: number) => ((val - 1) >> (idx * 2)) & 0x03; // 0..3
     * const parts = [
     *   computePartValue(msg.media.value, 0),
     *   computePartValue(msg.media.value, 1),
     *   computePartValue(msg.media.value, 2),
     * ]
     * ```
     *
     * Each part of the value corresponds to a particular slot (i.e. part 0 is left slot,
     * part 1 is middle, part 2 is right). The slot values are as follows:
     *  - 0: BAR (displayed as a *BAR* sign on a black background)
     *  - 1: BERRIES (displayed as berries, similar to emoji üçá)
     *  - 2: LEMON (displayed as a lemon, similar to emoji üçã)
     *  - 3: SEVEN (displayed as a red digit 7)
     *
     * Therefore, the winning value (i.e. `777`) is represented as `(3 << 4 | 3 << 2 | 3 << 0) + 1 = 64`
     *
     * To determine the needed animation parts, you'll need to apply some shifts.
     * These are the offsets for the individual symbols:
     *  - WIN_SEVEN: 0
     *  - SEVEN: 1
     *  - BAR: 2
     *  - BERRIES: 3
     *  - LEMON: 4
     *
     * And these are the shifts for each slot:
     *  - LEFT: 3
     *  - MIDDLE: 9
     *  - RIGHT: 15
     *
     * > WIN_SEVEN is the same as SEVEN, but only used if the machine result is `777` (i.e. `value = 64`),
     * > as it contains additional "blinking" animation.
     *
     * The sticker index is computed as follows: `SHIFTS[SLOT] + OFFSETS[SYM]`.
     * For example, berries for the middle slot would be: `SHIFTS[MIDDLE] + OFFSETS[BERRIES] = 9 + 3 = 12`
     *
     * Currently, this sticker set is used for the machine: [SlotMachineAnimated](https://t.me/addstickers/SlotMachineAnimated)
